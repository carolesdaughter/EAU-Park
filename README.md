# Streetball-Silent-Aim:

Originally when I first made this, I announced the release of a GUI for Streetball, due to the owner of the server I announced it in eventually deciding to start selling already-released scripts, I've decided to distance myself from that & the GUI will most likely not be made, this repository will be edited if it is made.

# Usage

Just jump when you're in footing, will automatically change power for you (if it is enabled)

Moderators can view your screen and they will be able to see whether or not you're clicking and aiming correctly. I cannot fix this due to Solara being an external executor.

Requires Synapse, Script-Ware (Windows & Mac most likely), Fluxus, or KRNL

I'd recommend using this loadstring script incase an update is pushed out for the aimbot:
```
-- // due to high ping making autopower useless sometimes, ive added a toggle for it if you'd like to disable it
getgenv().AutoPower = true -- // change to false to disable automatic power changing

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/6ce/Streetball-Silent-Aim/main/SilentAimbot.lua"))()
```
